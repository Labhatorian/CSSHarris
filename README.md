## MHeet
As stated Overkoepelend will contain the main project. This project will create a website where users can chat with each other. In addition, they will be able to create an account and create their own room. There will be roles for moderators and admins so they can do special actions within the system.

You can access MHeet on the website https://cssharris.hbo-ict.org/ for as long as the Skylab virtual machines stay up.

### Workflow
MHeet has a workflow script to build and test the MHeet project and only the MHeet project. If this passes it will auto-merge, even if nothing has been commited to the project. Deploying to Skylab is no longer a requirement.

### Design documents
Being considerend.

## Afterword
This semester has been a chaos due to the absolute amount of work we have had to do with the unclear information that we had. The pressure has been high throughout the entire semester and I am dissatisfied with how it went. I am glad this is all over.
