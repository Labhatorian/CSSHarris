## Structure
This semester took 8 weeks from week 7 to week 14 in 2023. Throughout the semester I learnt about ASP NET Core and Javascript. Everything I have done has been put in this repository for safekeeping. Alongside ClientTech and ServerTech there is also Security where I had to create a portfolio built upon OWASP ASVS. You can see some of this back in MHeet

### Folders
ClientTech contains all the Client Technology class assignments from during the semester. This uses Node.js and vanilla Javascript.</br>
ServerTech contains all the Server Technology class assignments from during the semester. This uses C# in ASP NET 7.0 Core.</br>
Security contains one of the test projects before the migration to ASP .NET Core project with authorization through local accounts in localdb.</br>
Overkoepelend contains the main project MHeet that will use technology from the above to create a showcase to hand in to the university.</br>
Workshop contains all workshop files from Trendwatch 23 March 2023.

## MHeet
As stated Overkoepelend will contain the main project. This project will create a website where users can chat with each other. In addition, they will be able to create an account and create their own room. There will be roles for moderators and admins so they can do special actions within the system.

You can access MHeet on the website https://cssharris.hbo-ict.org/ for as long as the Skylab virtual machines stay up.

### Workflow
MHeet has a workflow script to build and test the MHeet project and only the MHeet project. If this passes it will auto-merge, even if nothing has been commited to the project. Deploying to Skylab is no longer a requirement.

### Design documents
Being considerend.

## Afterword
This semester has not been the greatest due to amount of work that we had to do with barely any information. For the next time I wish for clearer requirements and explanation what exactly needs to be done and how. Especially with the Security portfolio and Tasker assignments I had the most trouble with.
