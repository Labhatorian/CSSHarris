# Security Policy
We take security seriously and wish to prevent them whenever possible. This security policy is for the Overkoepelend folder ONLY.

## Supported Versions
The latest will always be the supported version. This also includes both main and ev branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

1. Create a new Security Advisory through the Security tab.
2. Use the provided template to give as much information as possible
3. Submit the advisory

## Working on a Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities should be worked on as soon as possible. This is due to the fact that as soon as an advisory is published, it becomes public knowledge and open for exploiting. To work on a vulnerability, follow the steps below.

1. Create a new branch with a clear name
2. Commit work in clear language what you have done
3. Test changes in code out and check if no new vulnerabilities have opened up
4. When finished, create a pull request so it can be merged.
5. Remove the branch if the merge has been succesful and tested

## Preferred Languages
We prefer all communications to be in Dutch or English.
